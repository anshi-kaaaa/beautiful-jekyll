I am Anshika, an undergrad student from the University of Delhi, India. I am pursuing my degree in biochemistry and am very interested in bioinformatics. Being from a non-technical background, I often find it challenging to learn bioinformatics. I would have many questions but could not find the right people to ask or discuss them. And have found that many students and researchers are going through the same situation.
Therefore with the help of my mentor Yo Yehudi, as a part of open life science, I have created the website Newbies in Bioinformatics.
The website aims to promote bioinformatics amongst beginners,by  discussing challenges and biases faced by beginners, and providing insights from experts.
The website currently includes four posts.
The first post is about the challenges faced by a newbie and an open invitation to anyone who wants to contribute.
The second post includes an interview with Dr. Sandeep Kumar Dhanda, who is a well-established bioinformatician, answering the basic questions of a newbie. 
The third post is a guest blog by Yo Yehudi about getting started with Git and GitHub. Where she beautifully explains GitHub and some basic concepts about why it can be useful to someone getting started doing computational work
The following post is a blog by Ankit Kumar, who is a software engineer. In the blog, he discusses the challenges faced by him while learning bioinformatics and the possible solutions to those challenges like finding open source and free alternatives for paid tools and understanding the working of tools.
The website is open for contributions. 
Experts in the field of computational biology, bioinformatics, computer science, and open source  are welcome to share their knowledge with the newbies.
Beginners and people with intermediate knowledge of bioinformatics are also encouraged to discuss the challenges and biases they have faced while learning bioinformatics.
Contributions can be in the form of a guest blog or interview. For contributions, one can reach the contributing.md in the GitHub repository. Suggestions of the topics you could contribute to can be found as issues in GitHub. Some of the topics of issues are genomics, proteomics, open-source, and bioinformatics applications in different fields like agriculture and neuroscience. Please comment on a github issue or email newbiesinbioinformatics@gmail.com if youâ€™d like to post an article that you think might fit  or re-post an existing article.
Now I would like to thank the contributors of the website. 
Yo Yehudi, Dr. Sandeep Kumar Dhanda, Ankit Kumar, Dr. Emma Karoune
